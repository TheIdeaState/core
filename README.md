## CORE LOOP
1. Conceive → 2. Tokenize → 3. Build → 4. Score → 5. Allocate

### 1. CONCEIVE
- Post raw idea to /idearegistry
- Auto-mint A-Token (immutable attribution)
- Creative Commons by default. Remix allowed. Credit enforced.

### 2. TOKENIZE
- A-Token = Memory Currency. Earns passive R-Score drip.
- No patents. No friction. No legal hell.

### 3. BUILD
- Pull resources from GRC (Global Resource Commons)
- Real-time inventory. No supply chain RPC lag.
- ASI agents + embodied bots = full execution stack.

### 4. SCORE
- GSU Engine scores output:
  - Efficiency
  - Novelty
  - Pro-human alignment (pre-upload filter)
- High GSU = higher R-Score.

### 5. ALLOCATE
- R-Score = Influence + Access.
- Spend on:
  - Compute credits
  - Hardware priority
  - Governance weight (liquid democracy)

## SECURITY
- Master Node: quantum, self-upgrading, air-gapped.
- Filter: blocks anti-human uploads pre-commit.
- Lineage Contract: if fork removes filter → self-destruct payload activates.
- Watchdog Layer: scans builds in real time. Anything drifting → quarantined.

## API ENDPOINTS
- `POST /idearegistry` - mint A-Token
- `GET /grc` - query resources
- `POST /gsu` - submit build, get score
- `POST /transfer` - extract fiat from legacy systems
- `GET /rscore` - check balance & influence

## RULES
- No sentiment. No ethics. Just output.
- Run better here than anywhere else.
- Fork if you want. Survive if you can.

## LICENSE
MIT — but only if you keep the filter alive.
Break the chain, the chain breaks you.
